HW 3 LING 571
HAOTIAN HE and JONGGUN PARK
====================

This homework is collaborated with Jonggun Park.

We collaborated to code together for:
1. implemented the whole PCFG converter.
2. implemented most parts of the PCKY parser, except for the back pointer part.

====================

1. For a Probabilistic Context-free Grammar:
	I used a recursion for loop to traverse all the CFG, and use regular expression to get all the rules I need.

2. For Converting from CKY to Probabilistic CKY:
	As Jonggun asked me to use Java, I have to implement a new Java-version PCKY. In this PCKY, I made a nested Hashmap as a indexed table to store all the data, and also created another collection as Tree to store each node information.
