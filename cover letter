Dear Sir/Madam,

Language is my passion, and I relish computatizing it. I hope I could enjoy having continuous fun with it.

For early years, I studied and worked on speech, and since then, developed keen interest, strong motivations and firm determination on computational linguistics. I learned and taught languages, participating in establishing speech databases for TTS, and involving in various, national or personal, researches in speech during my college study. In my master's study, I am not limited to speech. I've learned more about Chinese grammar, statistical modeling, and machine translation as I attended relevant courses, worked as a research assistant, and conducted certain independent studies under my advisors. Those valuable experiences help me to establish a comprehensive and solid understanding of computational linguistics. I am looking for a position as a computational linguist, as I'm really excited to contribute my linguistic knowledge and language processing skills to benefit Amplify.

I am really looking forward to join this large stage to enrich my experience in the work I love. A resume is attached below for your consideration, from which you will understand why I am yearning for working at Amplify. Please call me (206) 953-6672, if you have any question about my education, experience and skills.
Thank you for your time and consideration.
Sincerely,

Haotian He
